                                        Unfortunately, some stains can’t be removed even when we try our best and
                                        repeated applications of the chemicals can result in damaging the fabric. If

                                    <p>On occasion, we will receive an item we are unable to clean due a number of

                                        we will update your order to ensure you aren’t charged. On delivery, the item
                                        will be received with a special tag to give you the full details.

                                        So why wouldn't we clean an item?

                                        Some items are received without a care label and so we cannot be sure of the
                                        exact fabrics it is made from. We can most certainly suggest the best way to
                                        clean these items however there is an increased risk due to the unknown
                                        aspects. If you are happy for us to clean it as we see fit, send it back on
                                        your next order and leave a note in the special instructions to give us the go
                                        ahead and we would request you waive liability of damage through cleaning.

                                        Some items are received with pre-existing damage which we will make a note of
                                        in our system. Cleaning these items can accentuate that damage so we don’t want
                                        to risk it without your go ahead. If you would like us to clean the item and
                                        accept that risk, please send it on your next order and leave a note in the
                                        special instructions.</p>

                                <div class="desc">
                                    <p>The fundamental difference between dry cleaning and wet washing is water;
                                        dry-cleaning does not use water while wet washing does.

                                        Most dry cleaners use a chemical solvent called perchloroethylene (PERC) or
                                        Hydrocarbon to get rid of stains while the process of wet washing uses gentler
                                        soaps and detergents.

                                        Here at Washapp, we will always follow the garment's care label to ensure we
                                        use the best process and for the best results. We can service items that
                                        require dry cleaning as well as standard wet washing.</p>

                                    <p>Women’s blouses for example are often more delicate than men’s shirts and the
                                        tailored fit often requires more care and attention at our end. This means they
                                        must be hand-finished and require more time and attention in order to ensure a
                                        high-quality finish. For this reason, the price for blouses and other delicate
                                        items may be higher.

                                        All of our pricing is clearly explained on our website and our mobile app so
                                        there won’t be any surprises or hidden costs.</p>

                                        Note: We do have a Rs. 200/- cancellation fee for Deliveries, if we arrive
                                        within the timeslot but cannot reach anyone at the property.</p>

                                    <p>Knowing the hour time slot that your Washapp Agent will arrive in is useful at
                                        this phase, but we like to be more specific than that. In our next update, You
                                        will receive a text message with the ETA of the driver arrival as well as being
                                        able to follow him on a map.

                                        Unfortunately this functionality is not available for the Website and App at

                                        If you need to pass on a message, for example if you would like your order left
                                        at a reception, you can leave a delivery note when placing the order or
                                        alternatively you can leave a message with a member of our customer care team.</p>

                                        can come to you a bit early. If this is convenient for you, you just need to
                                        reply "Yes" to the SMS message and the driver will know he can attend early.

                                        Here at Washapp we understand that being early can be just as inconvenient as
                                        being late so please don’t worry if you get an SMS message and are not
                                        available. Simply ignore the message and the driver will be with you at your

                                        For our mobile users, shake your phone for the voucher code box to pop up.</p>

                                    <p>Within the app you have your own special code that you can share with your

                                        Your friends will get referral discount with your code, but remember this is
                                        only applicable for friends who haven't yet placed an order with us.

                                        After they’ve placed their order using your code you will be sent a code by
                                        email.

                                        And the beauty of our referral scheme is you can refer as many friends as you’d
                                        like!</p>
